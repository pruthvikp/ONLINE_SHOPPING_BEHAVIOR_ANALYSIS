## Introduction
In the ever-evolving landscape of e-commerce, traditional market approaches face significant limitations. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict whether a customer visiting a website will make a purchase, enhancing the overall shopping experience.

## Problem Statement
Understanding customer behavior is crucial for businesses to optimize their marketing strategies and enhance customer satisfaction. By analyzing customer browsing and shopping data and predicting whether a customer will make a purchase through machine learning applications, one can increase the overall sales of an e-commerce business.

## Aim and Objectives
1. Predict Customer Purchase Behavior.
2. Enhance Marketing Strategies.
3. Evaluate Multiple Machine Learning Algorithms.
4. Develop a Real-time Prediction Tool.
5. Visualize Model Performance.
6. Handle Data Preprocessing.

## Existing Solution
Traditional e-commerce businesses face several limitations, such as limited personalization, manual decision-making, static product displays, static pricing strategies, ineffective marketing, limited insights, and missed opportunities for upselling and cross-selling.

## Application
1. Personalized User Experience
2. Business Intelligence and Analytics
3. Targeted Marketing
4. Customer Retention
5. Enhanced Customer Support
6. Sales and Revenue Optimization

## System Architecture
The system architecture includes a Flask backend running machine learning models and a web frontend using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to handle user input and display predictions.

## Dataset and Features
The dataset includes various features representing different aspects of customer interaction with an e-commerce website, such as:
- Administrative pages visited and duration
- Informational pages visited and duration
- Product-related pages visited and duration
- BounceRates, ExitRates, PageValues
- SpecialDay, Month, OperatingSystems, Browser, Region, TrafficType, VisitorType, Weekend

The target variable is `Revenue`, indicating whether a purchase was made or not.

## Data Preprocessing
1. Handling Missing Values
2. Encoding Categorical Variables
3. Scaling Features

## ML Models Implemented

1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
2. Naive Bayes
3. Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
4. Random Forest

## Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Detailed performance analysis and visualizations are provided for each model.

## Web Application
A user-friendly web application is developed using Flask, allowing businesses to input customer data and receive immediate purchase predictions, facilitating real-time decision-making.

## Tools and Technology
- Python
- Flask
- scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Conclusion and Future Work
The project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict online shopping behavior, providing actionable insights for e-commerce businesses. Future work includes enhancing the model's predictive accuracy, incorporating additional features, and exploring new machine learning algorithms.
